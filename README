Note := in printing logical and physical bucket
        
        (x1,y1)--(x2,y2)
        
        which is rectangle R where x1,y1 is bottom left and x2,y2 is upper right 
        
        and x1 and y1 are included into it but but x2 any y2 are not part in
        
        basically 
          any point (x,y)
            
            if ( x1 <= x < x2) and ( y1 <= y < y2)
                
                is inside Ract
                
            else not
            
     :=  data in bucket are in form of  <id> <x> <y> 
      
      
     :=  in print Physical bucket 
           
           it will print coordinate of bucket and respactive bucket file name
            
           so we can check which point are inside in  (1,2)--(12,11) by 121-0.txt
            
           eg.
           
           (1,2)--(12,11)
           
           121-0.txt
                                
                                
                                (12,11)

            |                    |
            |                    |
            +--------------------+
          (1,2)

     
     := for line partation if x is divide bucket then
     
         any point (x,y)

            |         |          |

            +---------|----------+
            0         X          5
         
          X is divide region into two part
          
          any point (x,y)  
             
             if  x >= X :
                   inside region 2
             
             else:
                   inside region 1     
      
      


How to run the file ?

1. Make an input.txt file as mentioned in the question and keep it in the same folder as project.cpp
2. Execute project.cpp on terminal using the following commands
   a. g++ project.cpp
   b. ./a.out
   
   It will ask to enter the size of bucket
   eg: Enter  size of bucket :=101

   further on executing it will ask the inputs for bottom left and top right cordinates of query region(rectangle) and you can give two space sperated values.
   eg: bottom left point : 100 5   
       upper right point : 300 300

3. After execution it will generate the buckets that are the physical space containing the desired points.
   Also in terminal the output will be printed as follows

   list of bucket  --> 13
   15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  24  25  26  28  30
   out put of query -->
   3379

4. to confirm whether the outputs are correct or not , we have created test_output.cpp which find the solution using brute force, comapares the above result with that of brute force approach and tells whether the output is correct or not.

5. So after executing project.cpp , 
   a. change the values of Q.x1 and Q.x2 with the same values as that of bottom left corner and top rigjht corner respectively.
   b. save the file
   c. execute the file using 
       i. g++ test_output.cpp
       ii. ./a.out

6. If our answer is correct , then it will print "correct output" on the terminal.

7.genetare_input.cpp will generate random 'N' sample input in input.txt file
